# AirBnB Clone - The Console

This is the repository for the AirBnB Clone console project. The console serves as a command interpreter that allows you to modify and manage the AirBnB database. It provides administrators with the ability to manipulate various objects and data within the application.

## Getting Started
To get started with the AirBnB Clone console, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/OsiroA/AirBnB_clone.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd AirBnB_clone
```

3. Run the console:
```
./console.py
```

## Usage
Once the console is running, you can start executing commands to interact with the AirBnB database. The console provides a set of commands that allow you to create, read, update, and delete various objects. Some examples of commands you can use are:

- `create <class>` - Create a new instance of a class (e.g., User, Place, Review).
- `show <class> <id>` - Display the details of a specific instance.
- `update <class> <id> <attribute> <value>` - Update the attribute of a specific instance.
- `destroy <class> <id>` - Remove a specific instance from the database.
- `all` - Display all instances of a class or all instances in the database.

For a complete list of available commands and their usage, you can use the `help` command within the console.

## Dependencies
The AirBnB Clone console is built using Python. It relies on the following dependencies:
- JSON (for data serialization)
- sys (for system-specific parameters and functions)
- cmd (for building command-line interpreters)

Make sure to have these dependencies installed before running the console.
